# Job Market Scraper &  Analysis

As a junior developer searching for employment opportunities, I have created this repository to host a web scraper capable of extracting valuable job listing data from popular Spanish and international employment portals. Utilizing Puppeteer, I am able to gather essential details about available positions, allowing me to analyze the demand for different technologies and frameworks in my area (A Coruña) and remote locations.

As a junior developer looking for employment, you'll get tons of conflicting information about what should you focus on. With so much noise, I decided to gather an extract information from popular spanish and international job listings, so I can have more actionable information about positions in my area (A Coruña) and remote ones.

## Stack:

- **Puppeteer** for most of the heavy lifting. It provides excelent tools to control a Chromium instance.
- **Flask** for serving a local instance of QA and Zero-shot classification.
  **DuckDB** for storing and analytics.
